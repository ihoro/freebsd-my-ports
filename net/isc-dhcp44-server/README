TODO: there is also an issue with schg flag, see notes below.

Reproduce:
- install FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE
- pkg install isc-dhcp44-server
- configure etc/rc.conf to enable it with chroot (see pkg install output)
  - set ifaces to em0 or something
- configure /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf to align subnet with em0 inet
- chflags schg /etc/resolv.conf
- service isc-dhcpd start
- FAILED:

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd: ERROR: unable to copy /etc/host.conf to /var/db/dhcpd/etc/host.conf -- not a file or a directory


reproduce 2:
- install 13 with defaults
- the rest the same

Use case:
- local_unbound is enabled and dhclient are used as the same time, and "chflags schg /etc/resolv.conf" is used

officially: chflags schg /etc/resolv.conf is used
