Please, note that tahometer's built-in update mechanism was turned off.
You can update tahometer via ports sub-system as usually. The reason is
that some updates are forced, i.e. tahometer doesn't work until you
accept updating. And without root access you cannot do that. Also, it
means that you cannot use 'portable version' option, which simply means
to keep your settings/data near the executable itself.
